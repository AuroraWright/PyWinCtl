First off, my most sincere thanks and acknowledgement to macdeport (https://github.com/macdeport) and holychowders (https://github.com/holychowders) for their help and moral boost.

PyGetWindow-MP (Multi-Platform)
==============================

This is a fork from asweigart's PyGetWindow module (https://github.com/asweigart/PyGetWindow), intended to obtain GUI information on and control application's windows.

This fork adds Linux and macOS experimental support to the MS Windowsâ„¢-only original module, in the hope others can use it, test it or contribute

#### USING THIS CODE

If you want to use this code or contribute, you can either:

* Create a fork of this repository, or 
* Download the repository, uncompress, and open it on your IDE of choice (e.g. PyCharm)

Be sure you install all dependencies described on "docs/requirements.txt" by using pip

In case you have any issues, comments or suggestions, do not hesitate to open an issue, or contact me (palookjones@gmail.com)

#### TEST

To test this module on your own system, cd to "tests" folder and run:

    pytest -vv test_pygetwindow.py

#### INSTALL

To install this module on your system, download the wheel file (.whl) located in "dist" folder, and run:

    python3 -m pip install PyGetWindowMP-0.0.9-py3-none-any.whl

You may want to add '--force-reinstall' option to be sure you are installing the right dependencies version.

#### IMPORTANT MacOS NOTICE:

macOS doesn't "like" controlling windows from other apps, so there are two separate classes you can use:

- To control your own application's windows: MacOSNSWindow() is based on NSWindow Objects (you have to pass the NSApp() Object reference. It means you have to be the "owner" of the application you want to control). To test macOS NSWindow class, you can run "python3 test_MacNSWindow.py" (also located in "tests" folder)
- To control other applications' windows: MacOSWindow() is based on Apple Script, so it is not fully trustable, but it's working fine in most cases. This other class can be tested together with the other modules, as described above, using "test_pygetwindow.py" script.
