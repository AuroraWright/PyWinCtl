Linux:
- Test other combinations (especially for sendBehind()). Tested OK: Ubuntu/GNOME and Mint/Cinnamon

Windows:
- sendBehind(False): Find a smarter way to update window (now it's minimize/restore)
- SendBottom(): Find a way to filter user vs. system apps. It should be doable like in Task Manager!!!
- alwaysOnBottom(): Try to find other smarter methods to keep window at the bottom (now it's a thread)

macOS / AppleScript:
- In general, find a way to optimize all appScript calls in terms of time and resources

- alwaysOnTop(): Try to find other smarter methods to keep window at the top (now it's a thread)
- alwaysOnBottom(): Try to find other smarter methods to keep window at the bottom (now it's a thread)
- sendBehind(): Is it even possible???
- acceptInput(): Is it even possible???
